Subject: Thank you

Hi Luis,
Thank you for taking the time to talk with me this evening about our classmate and friend, Adonica
Black.
I am deeply despaired that this tragedy has happened to this child and her family and as we
discussed, I am asking for your help and support as I feel it is so important to help this family at their
deepest hour.
Here is the synopsis of the events that have occurred to this point to my knowledge.
The child, Adonica Black, 15 years old, a sophomore at Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida
had been experiencing chronic back and neck pain since May. Evidently the mom had seen a
pediatrician in Boca Raton and there were xrays done which were negative. Periodic tests and follow
up xrays were done at some point and it is my understanding that Chiropractic and physical therapy
were recommended along with muscle relaxers and around the clock ibuprofen. Pediatrician is Dr.
Cutler - Pediatric Associates- West Boca Community Hospital.
Two weeks ago Thursday the child awoke with so much pain she could not move her head from side
to side and the mom took the child to the emergency room. An xray was taken and showed a
"scoliosis" . The mom- Diane Johnson Black, refused to leave the emergency room and requested an
MRI, which doctors did not think was necessary, but agreed to proceed at the mom's request, and the
patient, Adonica Black was "worked in" on a full schedule. Upon immediately reviewing the results of
the MRI, the attending emergency room physician came out and told the mother and confirmed by
written radiologist test results that unfortunately the patient had a potential malignancy- an
astrocytoma -5 cm at the base of the medula of the brain with accompanying potential cysts, which
had grown vertically into the spinal column.
The child was transported by air helicopter to Miami Children's Hospital that evening and admitted.
Surgery could not be performed immediately due to short notice on medical staff and the fact that this
neurosurgical team only performs one operation of this severity and type per year. The child was
admitted to Miami Childrens Hospital and received additional testing. Test results showed no further
metastisis into the brain, however, the surgeon at Miami Childrens Hospital agreed and recomended
that the family get additional opinions.

 Immediately the mother contacted John Hopkins, Neurosurgeon Dr. George Jallo (410) 955-7851
9AM - 5PM, emergency number after hours is (410) 955-6070. His team met on Tuesday a week
ago and accepted the case with great hope including the Humana Insurance papers that were
faxed from the mother.
The mother was then told that the child could be transported by regular plane based on her then
medical condition this past Monday, and arrived at John Hopkins yesterday (Tuesday) for her consult.
She and her daughter, patient Adonica Black met with the neurosurgeon Dr. Jallo and surgery was
scheduled for this Friday morning at 7:30 am at John Hopkins. The mother was contacted by
Humana at her apartment in Maryland on Tuesday - Dr. Cook - Humana Medical Review - that the
patient was denied coverage due to being outside "the Network".
MARY MCDERMOTT, ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR JOHN HOPKINS, HAS TOLD THE
MOTHER THE CHILD WILL NOT HAVE SURGERY ON FRIDAY 10/29 UNLESS SHE
PROVIDES $60,000 IN CASH.
I pursued assistance with the following individuals today because I beleive in the power of the
American people and the medical community to save this child's life and to make this right. I work
in a Comprehensive Cancer Center and my parents have both been ravaged by this disease, and I
am a mother of three children. We would all take our children to the most experienced physician
and surgeon in the country to operate on our child in a life threatening situation.
Today, because I feel this is the highest priority I, along with Congressman Robert Wexler- DBoca Raton and his aide Lynne Brenes (561) 989-0956, contacted Humana CEO Mike Seltzer,
and his people denied coverage and did not come to the table or offer assistance and support to
this family in any way shape or form. Bill Rubin representing Humana (954)467-3993 was very
helpful and put us in touch with all of the Humana officials. National Institute of Health officials in
Bethesda, MD were contacted- Susan Ericksen (301) 496-5217 was contacted today by Lynne
Brenes to determine grant possibility/ eligibility through the oncology research department.
I am now in touch with Steven Uhlfelder in Tallahassee (850) 386-5323 representing Tenet Health
Care and Don Steigman (954) 776-1227 and cell (954) 610-2615 with Tenet Health Care, to see if
Tenet can provide the last hope of an overrride on the decision of Humana to provide the health
insurance coverage necessary to get this child into life saving surgery on Friday morning.
Luis, this family and Adonica Black needs our prayers and support. Please tell us what I CAN DO
TO GET THIS CHILD INTO SURGERY WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCED AND TALENTED
SURGEONS WHO CAN GIVE THIS CHILD HOPE OF LIFE.
I am available 24 hours a day at cell (954) 661-2262 and at work- (954) 355-4874. I only want to
help save this child's life. Thank you for your time, help and consideration.

RE: leaving florida

I am sorry you are leaving the state. I have been working to achieve med mal reform. The plaintiffs
lawyers have a lot of clout in the Florida legislature but we made some progress last year.
I appreciate your support of the President.

Dear Mr Bush:
This is the second email I am sending you. the first one was sent to talahassee but I received a
standard political response. One of my pt.s gave me this address.
I am a OB/GYN with 8000 pts and have been in Florida since 1990. I am another one that is
leaving the state because of high insurance rates, low reimbursements, and can't continue to
keep the office open. I gave up OB 1 year ago because of insurance going from 20,000 to
100,000 per year. There is a constant flow of people out of florida. I refuse to go bare like all of
my peers have done.\{
here is a copy of a letter I have sent to my patients.
please send a copy of this to your brother. Even though 3 is on the ballot, the lawyers are
laughing because they know that amendment 7 and 8 will pass. The system is so deplorable
now,..... can you imagine what will happen if kerry and edwards gets in??
thank all of the legislature for absolutely nothing.. we need reform of the insurance companies
and the legal system.
sincerely,

It's kinda hard to provide Jennifer Ludwig with my mom's info when she didn't give me an email addy or # so you can pass it
along. My mom is waiting to hear from someone about this.

She can contact my mom herself and get the info. I am fuming over it all. Everybody has the exact same problems. In my
situation, the adjuster wouldn't take my receipts, did not handle any personal items, nothing to do with my well, my jacuzzi,
etc, nor my ceiling that is falling in. I get to fill out paperwork when my check comes so they can address it. We are getting
ruded! My mom is not happy!

Not sure if you heard through the grapevine but I have resigned from the Association effective Jan. 31, 2005. Jim
Smith and Brian Ballard have offered me an opportunity to work with them and I am excited. I want to thank you for
always being so gracious to me during my tenure here at FAC. I know we have not always been on the same side but
you have always made yourself available to me and the organization and for that I am grateful.
I will be meeting w/ you soon on the hurricane issues, but wanted to let you know my news and to say “thanks.”

Taxes & FEMA Mitigation Grants
taxesFEMA_102804.doc

Governor, there was some recent action by the IRS that requires taxpayers to include FEMA's mitigation grants in their gross
income, thereby could be taxable income. Deputy Secretary Boden from Treasury wrote to you yesterday urging your support
to fix this statutorily…i.e., mitigation grants should not be included in gross income. Treasury has full support of OMB and
WH.
We should work to fix this in November…..but it's not an easy fix...it's a "tax provision," which could then become a "tax bill"
which then becomes a "Christmas tree." We're hoping folks will agree to let it "slip-in."
Attached is a memo describing the issue and recommended actions. We will have draft letters for your review tomorrow.
